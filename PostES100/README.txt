This folder is for updated files that were not submitted for the ES100 final report.  These files are for a physical build that did not end up being completed for ES100,
but that will be completed for actual lab use for the Harvard course on fluids, ES123.  Feel free to look at these files, but keep in mind that they are not for ES100.

Patch Notes:
April 8, 2021 - Added external system circuit diagram, addressed bug in load cell code
