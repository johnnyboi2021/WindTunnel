This folder is for updated files that were not submitted for the ES100 final report.  These files are for a physical build that did not end up being completed for ES100,
but that will be completed for actual lab use for the Harvard course on fluids, ES123.  Feel free to look at these files, but keep in mind that they are not for ES100.

Patch Notes:
April 8, 2021 - DONE: Added external system circuit diagram, addressed bug in load cell code of _WindTunnel.ino, flipped phsyical build so flow goes from left to right as
                      shown in the report, placed lift sensor underneath Al rod instead of above in order to measure (weight - lift) else the lift would only be positive for 
                      flying test objects, added hinge to top wall of test chamber for easy removal of test objects, added photos of the physical build.  
                TODO: Address power supply safety issue, make force measurements more stable and update faster in _WindTunnel.ino, add flow straighteners.
